# Prediction-of-customers-and-sales-for-Wegmans
Using linear regression and decision tree to predict customers' purchase and find out key drivers of their consumption.
# Project Goals
The purpose of this analysis is to understand category behaviors in the Greek Yogurt subcategory. This subcategory at the time of this survey was growing dramatically. Understanding different segments, usage situations, attribute importance, and brand perceptions is critical to determining the best approach to merchandising this growing category. 
# Survey Method and Sample Overview
The Wegmans survey was sent to a web panel of customers. The panel is voluntary, but for this survey they were offered a chance to win a $100 Wegmans shopping card. In general, the panel is a passionate group interested in expressing opinions to the company.
The survey was only sent to individuals that had previously purchased Greek Yogurt and were screened during the survey based on a question about purchase of Greek Yogurt. Thus, the sample is not a general sample of Wegmans customers, but instead a sample of current buyers of Greek Yogurt. Wegmans considered this the most relevant population for this survey.
# Audience
The main audience for this analysis is managers, but some of the managers are well‚Äêtrained in statistics and have been known to ask whether numbers are really different or not based on statistical tests or confidence intervals. Hence, while some of the audience is quite comfortable with numbers and statistics and will want some detail along these lines, others are less so and will want to be able to glean the insights easily without needing to fully comprehend all of the statistical analysis.
